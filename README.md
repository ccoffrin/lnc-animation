Lifted Nonlinear Cuts Animation
=====

### What is this?
This [technical report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04644) proposed two valid inequalities for the AC power flow equations in a 4-Dimensional space (w_i, w_j, w^r, w^i).
This R script produces a 2D animation of these inequalities in the w_i, w^r space.
The w_j variable is captured overtime and the w^i space is projected onto the 2D space.
The "receding" lines parts of the w^i space that and are projected onto the w_i, w^r space.

### Requirements
This script requires R for building the PDFs and imagemagick's convert for combining them into a gif.
